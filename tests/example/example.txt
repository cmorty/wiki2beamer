== Introduction ==

==== Welcome ====

Welcome to the wiki2beamer example presentation. We will do our best to
document and demonstrate all features of wiki2beamer in this file. It is not
meant to be a reference though, that will be the man page wiki2beamer(1).

==== Design goals ====

Wiki2beamer was written to make typesetting presentations with \LaTeX and
beamer easier. \LaTeX beamer can create beautiful presentations but it's
a very verbose language and most of the simple task like simple frames or
bullet lists take an awfull amount of code. This of scares away beginners and
fellow colleagues from even starting with the tool. This is where wiki2beamer
steps in. It's designed to make the start easier and not remove any of the
powers of \LaTeX.

== Basic usage ==

=== Commandline ===
==== Commandline usage ====
Wiki2beamer is written in python and known to work on python 2.3 up to 2.6.
You can use it on Windows too, if you have the python interpreter installed
properly.

On *nix environments you would simple use it like this:
<[code][style=basic]
wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>

On Windows you would have to call the python interpreter with the wiki2beamer
script:
<[code][style=basic]
python wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>


=== The big picture ===

==== The big picture ====
A latex beamer document consists (like any latex document) of some introductory
style definitions and the document body. In plain latex it looks like this:

<[code][style=basic]
\documentclass{beamer}
    %do some style-magic here
\begin{document}
    %insert your presentation here (body)
\end{document}
[code]>
wiki2beamer can produce both: only the body content of the presentation or a complete document.

==== body-only ====
If you want full control over all the fancy stuff you can do with latex, you
can use wiki2beamer to generate a .tex that that you can include with
@\textbackslash input\{filename.tex\}@.

<[code][style=basic]
\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
    \input{w2b-output.tex}
\end{document}
[code]>

This is the default mode of operation.

==== autotemplate ====
If you want wiki2beamer to generate a complete document with header, you can
use the autotemplate feature. It's a special environment in wiki2beamer
syntax and must be the first element in the input file. It has a simple
@key=\{value\}@ syntax. For a full reference see the man page.

<[code][style=basic]
<\[autotemplate\]
title={The Title}
author={Mr. Foo Bar}
date={1970-01-01}
titleframe=False
\[autotemplate\]>
[code]>

If the autotemplate environment is used, a default titleframe is generated. If
you want that disabled, you can switch it with the titleframe option.

=== Headers and Footers ===

==== Headers and Footers ====
Sometimes you want to repeat some latex code at the header and footer of your
presentation frames (e.g. to show logos or names). To make this easier you can
fill two special storage field @\@FRAMEHEADER=@ and @\@FRAMEFOOTER=@ with some
latex code. wiki2beamer will append or prepend this right after the frame
opening or frame closing in the resulting latex code.

@FRAMEHEADER=\begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEHEADER\end{flushright}
@FRAMEFOOTER=\vfill \begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEFOOTER\end{flushright}

==== Frame with generated header/footer ====

This is the text of the frame

%deleting header and footer
@FRAMEHEADER=
@FRAMEFOOTER=

== Advanced usage ==

=== Special environments ===

=== Misc ===

==== fragile frames ====
For some features to work (eg. verbatim content), latex beamer needs a frame
marked as fragile. In plain \LaTeX this would look like:
<[code][style=basic]
\begin{frame}\[fragile\]
...
\end{frame}
[code]>

This can be realized with wiki2beamer by simply appending a @[fragile]@ tag to the
frame header:

<[code][style=basic]
==== a fragile frame ====\[fragile\]
...
[code]>

==== a fragile frame ====[fragile]
this is a fragile frame
