== Introduction ==

==== Welcome ====

Welcome to the wiki2beamer example presentation. We will do our best to
document and demonstrate all features of wiki2beamer in this file. It is not
meant to be a reference though, that will be the man page wiki2beamer(1).

==== Design goals ====

Wiki2beamer was written to make typesetting presentations with \LaTeX and
beamer easier. \LaTeX beamer can create beautiful presentations but it's
a very verbose language and most of the simple tasks like using frames or
bullet lists take an awfull amount of code that looks really complicated.
This often scares away beginners and
fellow colleagues from even starting with \LaTeX. This is where wiki2beamer
steps in. It's designed to make the start easier and not remove any of the
powers of the language.

== Basic usage ==

=== Commandline ===
==== Commandline usage ====
Wiki2beamer is written in python and known to work on python 2.3 up to 2.6.
You can use it on Windows too, if you have the python interpreter installed
properly.

On *nix environments you would simple use it like this:
<[code][style=basic]
wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>

On Windows you would have to call the python interpreter with the wiki2beamer
script:
<[code][style=basic]
python wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>


=== The big picture ===

==== The big picture ====
A latex beamer document consists (like any latex document) of some introductory
style definitions and the document body. In plain latex it looks like this:

<[code][style=basic]
\documentclass{beamer}
    %do some style-magic here
\begin{document}
    %insert your presentation here (body)
\end{document}
[code]>
wiki2beamer can produce both: only the body content of the presentation or a complete document.

==== body-only ====
If you want full control over all the fancy stuff you can do with latex, you
can use wiki2beamer to generate a .tex that that you can include with
@\textbackslash input\{filename.tex\}@.

<[code][style=basic]
\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
    \input{w2b-output.tex}
\end{document}
[code]>

This is the default mode of operation.

==== autotemplate ====
If you want wiki2beamer to generate a complete document with header, you can
use the autotemplate feature. It's a special environment in wiki2beamer
syntax and must be the first element in the input file. It has a simple
@key=\{value\}@ syntax. For a full reference see the man page.

<[code][style=basic]
<\[autotemplate\]
title={The Title}
author={Mr. Foo Bar}
date={1970-01-01}
titleframe=False
\[autotemplate\]>
[code]>

If the autotemplate environment is used, a default titleframe is generated. If
you want that disabled, you can switch it with the titleframe option.

=== Structure and frames ===

==== Strucuture and frames ====

As most wiki-dialects, wiki2beamer supports the famous

<[center]
@==== title ====@
[center]>

syntax. When these markings start at the beginning of a line, wiki2beamer
expands them to open a frame.

==== Structure and frames ====

The following heading markups exist:

--1em--

@== title ==@ --> opens a section

--1em--

@=== title ===@ --> opens a subsection

--1em--

@==== title ====@ --> opens a frame

--1em--

Frames will be closed automatically when a new sectioning or frame markup
appears. Frames can also be closed with an optional @[frame]>@ marking
(usually only needed to write advanced LaTeX code between frames).

[frame]>

% now you can put your fancy LaTeX code here (outside of a frame)

=== Lists ===

==== Lists ====

Probably one of the most used text elements in presentations
are:
* bullet
* lists
and
# numbered
# lists

==== Bullet Lists ====

Bullet lists can be created by prepending one or many @*@ before a line
<[code][style=basic]
* A simple bullet list
* with two items
[code]>

Bullet list can also be multi-level:
<[code][style=basic]
* A more complex bullet list
** with a sublist
** and another sublist
*** here
[code]>

==== Bullet Lists (output) ====

* A simple bullet list
* with two items

* A more complex bullet list
** with a sublist
** and another sublist
*** here


==== Numbered Lists ====

The same works for numbered lists
<[code][style=basic]
# first item
# second item
## with two subitems
## and onother
### subsubitem
# third item
[code]>

==== Numbered Lists (output) ==== 

# first item
# second item
## with two subitems
## and onother
### subsubitem
# third item

==== Mixed Lists ====

Numbered and bullet lists can be mixed:
<[code][style=basic]
# first item
#* with a sub-list
#*# one numbered subsub-item
#*# another numbered subsub-item
#* and a lone bullet
# second item
[code]>

==== Mixed Lists (output) ====

# first item
#* with a sub-list
#*# one numbered subsub-item
#*# another numbered subsub-item
#* and a lone bullet
# second item

=== Text markup ===

==== Text markup ====

Text can be formatted with some markups. Some markups can be escaped with a
\textbackslash.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
markup & output & escaping \\\hline
\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{'''bold text'''}
[nowiki]>
	& '''bold text''' & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{''italic text''}
[nowiki]>
	& ''italic text'' & \\\hline

<[nowiki]
\texttt{@teletype text@}
[nowiki]>
	& @teletype text@ & \textbackslash@ \\\hline

<[nowiki]
\texttt{!alerted text!}
[nowiki]>
	& !alerted text! & \textbackslash! \\\hline

<[nowiki]
\texttt{\_color\_colored text\_}
[nowiki]>
	& _blue_blue text_ & \\\hline
\end{tabular}

==== Text substitutions ====

There are some simple text replacements you can use:

--2em--

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
markup & output & escaping \\\hline
\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{-->}
[nowiki]>
	& --> & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{<--}
[nowiki]>
	& <-- & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{==>}
[nowiki]>
	& ==> & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{<==}
[nowiki]>
	& <== & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{:-)}
[nowiki]>
	& :-) & \\\hline
<[nowiki]
\texttt{:-(}
[nowiki]>
	& :-( & \\\hline
\end{tabular}


==== Footnotes ====

You can also use footnotes on your slides(((This is such a footnote.))).

--2em--

<[code][style=basic]
...your slides(((This is such a footnote.))).
[code]>

=== Environments ===

=== Escaping ===

=== Layout ===

==== Vertical Space ====

You can insert vertical space between two paragraphs with the

<[center]
<[nowiki]
\texttt{--length--}
[nowiki]>
[center]>

notation where ''length'' can be a valid latex length expression (e.g. @1cm@, @1pt@, @1em@ or even
@0.2\textbackslash textwidth@). This space will be squeezed by latex when the
page is full. To really force LaTeX to insert a space, use the
alternative

<[center]
<[nowiki]
\texttt{--*length--}
[nowiki]>
[center]>

notation.



==== Columns ====
Latex beamer can devide the current frame into collumns.
In wiki2beamer this can be done with the following notation:
<[code][style=basic]
<\[columns\]

\[\[\[width\]\]\]
this is the first column

\[\[\[width\]\]\]
this is the second column

\[columns\]>
[code]>

where ''width'' is a valid latex length expression.

==== Columns example ====
<[code][style=basic]
\centering
Text above the columns

<\[columns\]

\[\[\[0.4\textwidth\]\]\]
this is:
* the first column
* with a list

\[\[\[0.4\textwidth\]\]\]
this is:
* the second column
* with another list

\[columns\]>

\centering
Text below the columns
[code]>


==== Columns example (output) ====
\centering
Text above the columns.

<[columns]

[[[0.4\textwidth]]]
this is:
* the first column
* with a list

[[[0.4\textwidth]]]
this is:
* the second column
* with another list

[columns]>

\centering
Text below the columns.


=== Headers and Footers ===

==== Headers and Footers ====
Sometimes you want to repeat some latex code at the header and footer of your
presentation frames (e.g. to show logos or names). To make this easier you can
fill two special storage field @\@FRAMEHEADER=@ and @\@FRAMEFOOTER=@ with some
latex code. wiki2beamer will append or prepend this right after the frame
opening or frame closing in the resulting latex code.

@FRAMEHEADER=\begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEHEADER\end{flushright}
@FRAMEFOOTER=\vfill \begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEFOOTER\end{flushright}

==== Frame with generated header/footer ====

This is the text of the frame

%deleting header and footer
@FRAMEHEADER=
@FRAMEFOOTER=

== Graphics ==
==== Including graphics ====
LaTeX can include graphics with the @\textbackslash includegraphics@ command.
To ease the use, wiki2beamer provides a simple syntax.

simple:
<[code][style=basic]
<<<graphicsfile.png>>>
[code]>

advanced:
<[code][style=basic]
<<<graphicsfile.png,option=foo>>>
[code]>

For a documentation of available options, take a look at the graphix package
documentation.

==== Graphics example ====

<[code][style=basic]
<<<db-rg1024.png,height=0.5\textheight>>>
[code]>

==== Graphics example (output) ====

<<<db-rg1024.png,height=0.5\textheight>>>

[center]>

==== Frame options ====

LaTeX supports giving arguments to opening frames. It looks like:
<[code][style=basic]
\begin{frame}\[someoption\]
[code]>

Such options can be added in wiki2beamer by appending them to the frame
opening:
<[code][style=basic]
==== frametitle ====\[someoption]
[code]>

One example are fragile frames.

==== Fragile frames ====
For some features to work (eg. verbatim content), latex beamer needs a frame
marked as fragile. In plain \LaTeX this would look like:
<[code][style=basic]
\begin{frame}\[fragile\]
...
\end{frame}
[code]>

This can be realized with wiki2beamer by simply appending a @[fragile]@ tag to the
frame header:

<[code][style=basic]
==== a fragile frame ====\[fragile\]
...
[code]>

==== a fragile frame ====[fragile]
This is such a fragile frame with some \verb-V#rb/\t|m t<xt- .
