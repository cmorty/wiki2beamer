== Introduction ==

==== Welcome ====

Welcome to the wiki2beamer example presentation. We will do our best to
document and demonstrate all features of wiki2beamer in this file. It is not
meant to be a reference though, that will be the man page wiki2beamer(1).

==== Design goals ====

Wiki2beamer was written to make typesetting presentations with \LaTeX and
beamer easier. \LaTeX beamer can create beautiful presentations but it's
a very verbose language and most of the simple task like simple frames or
bullet lists take an awfull amount of code. This of scares away beginners and
fellow colleagues from even starting with the tool. This is where wiki2beamer
steps in. It's designed to make the start easier and not remove any of the
powers of \LaTeX.

== Basic usage ==

=== Commandline ===
==== Commandline usage ====
Wiki2beamer is written in python and known to work on python 2.3 up to 2.6.
You can use it on Windows too, if you have the python interpreter installed
properly.

On *nix environments you would simple use it like this:
<[code]
wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>

On Windows you would have to call the python interpreter with the wiki2beamer
script:
<[code]
C:\Users\john\talk\python wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>
