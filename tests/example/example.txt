== Introduction ==

==== Welcome ====

Welcome to the wiki2beamer example presentation. We will do our best to
document and demonstrate all features of wiki2beamer in this file. It is not
meant to be a reference though, that will be the man page wiki2beamer(1).

==== Design goals ====

Wiki2beamer was written to make typesetting presentations with \LaTeX and
beamer easier. \LaTeX beamer can create beautiful presentations but it's
a very verbose language and most of the simple task like simple frames or
bullet lists take an awfull amount of code. This of scares away beginners and
fellow colleagues from even starting with the tool. This is where wiki2beamer
steps in. It's designed to make the start easier and not remove any of the
powers of \LaTeX.

== Basic usage ==

=== Commandline ===
==== Commandline usage ====
Wiki2beamer is written in python and known to work on python 2.3 up to 2.6.
You can use it on Windows too, if you have the python interpreter installed
properly.

On *nix environments you would simple use it like this:
<[code][style=basic]
wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>

On Windows you would have to call the python interpreter with the wiki2beamer
script:
<[code][style=basic]
python wiki2beamer example.txt > example.tex
[code]>


=== Structure and Frames ===

==== The document ====
To create a working latex beamer presentation .tex file, you have to begin
your


=== Headers and Footers ===

==== Headers and Footers ====
Sometimes you want to repeat some latex code at the header and footer of your
presentation frames (e.g. to show logos or names). To make this easier you can
fill two special storage field @\@FRAMEHEADER=@ and @\@FRAMEFOOTER=@ with some
latex code. wiki2beamer will append or prepend this right after the frame
opening or frame closing in the resulting latex code.

@FRAMEHEADER=\begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEHEADER\end{flushright}
@FRAMEFOOTER=\vfill \begin{flushright}This is a generated FRAMEFOOTER\end{flushright}

==== Frame with generated header/footer ====

This is the text of the frame

%deleting header and footer
@FRAMEHEADER=
@FRAMEFOOTER=

== Advanced usage ==



==== fragile frames ====
For some features to work (eg. verbatim content), latex beamer needs a frame
marked as fragile. In plain \LaTeX this would look like:
<[code][style=basic]
\begin{frame}\[fragile\]
...
\end{frame}
[code]>

This can be realized with wiki2beamer by simply appending a \[fragile\] to the
frame header:
<[code][style=basic]
==== a fragile frame ====\[fragile\]
...
[code]>

==== a fragile frame ====[fragile]
this is a fragile frame
